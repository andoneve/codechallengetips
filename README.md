Tips for code challenges

Here is my keynote as a html document.

Some categories considered by people reviewing code assignments:
* Operational-ness
  * Does it work?
  * Are the outputs correct for the sample input?

* Readability
  * Was it easy to follow the code?
  * Are method sizes reasonable?
  * Does it have a README? If so, does it tell you anything useful?

* Ease of maintenance
  * How easy would it be for another programmer to maintain and extend this code?
  * Is there unused code or comments?
  * Is there any duplicated code?

* Testing
  * Does it have testing of any kind?
  * How much coverage is there?
  * Evidence of Test-Driven-Development?
  * Is there at least one test that tests the sample input?

* Artistic impression
  * Follows conventions of language used?
  * Stylistically consistent
  * Is there too much over-engineering?
  * Typos?

* Design
  * Naming - methods named according to what they do
  * Organization - e.g., tests in own folder
  * Error strategy?
  * Software Design Patterns - used correctly? do you need it?
  * Encapsulation? - e.g., not exposing class methods to other classes and using Object-Oriented Design
  * Domain modeling - does the program model model the problem domain?

Tips:
* Don’t over-engineer
* At least try to do what they ask you (e.g., testing? try it!)
* Write a readme - explains your assumptions, how to run the program, and how to run the tests
* Ask for help if you need it
* Review your code before your interview and get comfortable explaining how it works. Be prepared to explain decisions that you made.
* Have a friend or coach review the assignment
* Focus on readability
* Follow the instructions
* Call
* If in person - explain what you are doing and your thoughts; don’t stop talking
* Can ask interviewer questions, e.g., “how would you approach this problem?”
* remember: interviewers are people too
* Best interview feels like a conversation
* Be honest about what you can’t do and focus on what you can do / love to do
* Don’t panic
* Keep track of your projects - case study - what you did, technologies, how long it took
